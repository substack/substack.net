    If you need one of the following services, I can provide that on an hourly
    independent contractor basis:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      rapid prototyping. If you can describe your problem in terms of what the
      inputs are and what the outputs should be, I can build it very quickly.
    </li>
    <li>
      modular web development. front and back and
      [in between](http://browserify.org).
      release management. finding good modules. testing.
      carefully untangling a ball of mud with tiny modules.
    </li>
    <li>
      open source support. If you need specialized feature development or need
      a line of support for present or future bugs in software I maintain.
    </li>
    <li>
      training. If you need to get a whole classroom full of folk up to speed
      quickly on the basics of node,
      <a href="https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook">browserify</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook">streams</a>,
      modularity, npm packages, frontends, backends, bash,
      <a href="https://github.com/substack/leveldb-handbook">leveldb</a>,
      or whatever else, I can educate as well as entertain!
      Requires an SF bay area location.
    </li>
    <li>
      mad science development.
      If you're not even sure if something is possible and need some mad science
      research feasibility and prototyping, I can investigate.
      Particularly if you need:
      <a href="http://hyperboot.org">web crypto</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/substack/keyboot">offline</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/substack/forkdb">replication-first</a>,
      or <a href="http://stack.gl/">webgl</a> research.
    </li>
    <li>
      art! I do that too.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    I use <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node</a> because it has 
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">a nice package manager</a>
    and <a href="http://nodeschool.io/">community</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are in the San Francisco Bay Area accessible from BART I may be able
    to meet in person where appropriate, but I'm often traveling.
    Assume remote. (irc and email work especially well)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It will cost you: $150 / hour.
    I use <a href="http://npmjs.org/package/clocker">clocker</a> to track hours
    and <a href="http://npmjs.org/package/invoicer">invoicer</a> to generate
    invoices.
  </p>
   
  <p>
    If you have a fitting project, email me about it!
    <a href="mailto:substack@gmail.com">substack@gmail.com</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Be direct. Minimize round-trip latency by providing necessary
    information up-front instead of asking questions that require very many
    follow-up responses.
